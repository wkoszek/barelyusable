# barelyusable
BarelyUsable.com stuff

Idea
----
- colaborative blog with guest writers
- fairly niche, however should target UI/UX designers
- should not be too negative, but instructional instead
  - every post should have a section on how company decided
    to implement a feature
  - what's the problem with this approach
  - how it could be engineered better
- main topic
  - usability engineering
  - UI/UX
  - design of nowadays things
- Reason for being:
  - noticing problems with usability in front of the computer, but not only
  - trying to understand if other users also face similar problems
  - getting better at UI/UX design
  - part of frustration, part of it is trying to really deep dive into usability of engineering problems.
