# BarelyUsable.com website source code

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wkoszek/barelyusable.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/wkoszek/barelyusable)

BarelyUsable is my UX/UI design site, which motivates me to get better on
usability topics.
Largely inspired by Nielsen's books the plan is to share things which I
notice on the websites which I visit and get frustrated by.
BarelyUsable.com is served from the this repository through Github Pages
(http://pages.github.com). Whatever you see on BarelyUsable comes from here.

## Introduction

Barely Usable is built with Jekyll (http://jekyllrb.com/) See the
`_config.yml` file for configuration. Click the badge from the beginning of
this file to see Travis Ci from building of the project.

## Idea

- colaborative blog with guest writers
- fairly niche, however should target UI/UX designers
- should not be too negative, but instructional instead
  - every post should have a section on how company decided
    to implement a feature
  - what's the problem with this approach
  - how it could be engineered better
- main topic
  - usability engineering
  - UI/UX
  - design of nowadays things
- Reason for being:
  - noticing problems with usability in front of the computer, but not only
  - trying to understand if other users also face similar problems
  - getting better at UI/UX design
  - part of frustration, part of it is trying to really deep dive into usability of engineering problems.


## Blurbs


Whenever a blurb is required, the following versions can be used:

1. 1-line introduction to my website about usability
   - Barely Usable is a usability engineering website, where the design and construction of real-life and Internet products are analyzed and criticized.

2. 1-paragraph introduction to my website about usability
   - Barely Usable was created in 2015 based on the belief that the design and construction of usable products is extremely difficult and that the only way to learn usability engineering is to look, notice, and criticize usability problems and suggest possible solutions. The domain of usability has been well known for years, yet the awareness of its importance has been scarce.  Barely Usable is meant to be a website where enthusiasts of user interface, user experience and human-computer interaction can collaborate on coming up with new and better solutions, making the world easier to use. We hope that gathering every resource together will help you develop the level of sensitivity necessary for creating usable objects. Barely Usable is brought to you by the founding team of Barvoy Inc.
