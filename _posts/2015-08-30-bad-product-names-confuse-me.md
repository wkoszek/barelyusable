[“Big buck"](http://neatdesigns.net/the-1-billion-ad-campaign-citis-live-richly/)
are paid every year to web marketing folks for figuring out and
delivering something that both attracts customers’ eyes and conveys
enough information about the product to make them continue reading the
pitch (If you haven’t yet seen Citi Bank’s “Live Richly” campaign, you
should check it out).
[Some](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Small) of
[them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different) are very
successful; [others aren’t](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-10-most-racist-ads-of-the-modern-era-2012-6?op=1),
but when it comes to marketing high-tech products, the situation is
difficult.

[Users don’t read](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/) your
website when [they don’t have time](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/).
So you must choose your words well. By no means am I an expert web
marketer, and I won’t even charge you $500/hr, yet from the user’s and
customer’s perspective I know what they want, so if you have five
minutes, bear with me and read on.

If you want me as a consumer to read your website, and spend … who knows
… maybe even a whole minute or even two on it, the content must be
**crystal** clear: I must be able to understand quickly what you do,
what you offer or what your product actually does. I suspect I’m
contravening some form of advertising and marketing law, since there are
a lot of websites which confuse me; I quickly smell the suspicious
content and then leave:

Compare this:

There is some fluff here, but the second line “Ansible is a …” is clear.
Let’s compare this with Docker’s pitch:

![](/images/2015-08-30-bad-product-names-make-me-confused/image01.png)

“It’s open and distributed, but what does it do”?

“What do you mean by ‘platform’?“

“You mean like a hardware?”

Yes, I do use [Docker](http://www.docker.com), but talking to couple
of guys at work and on Meetups we all agree: it’s pretty darn confusing
at first glance trying to understand what Docker actually is. We’re
talking about people who use separation/virtualization and who were
potential Docker adopters. Docker is just an example, there are many
companies who have problems trying to formulate, what they really do. So
we end up with “Uber for Laundry” instead of: “We pick laundry and wash
it for you”.

It’s been a while, but I don’t recall any [marketing
laws](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2012/12/15/book-the-22-laws-of-marketing/)
that stipulate hiding the role of products. Yes, you can [broaden the
category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Group) of your product
by naming it a certain way, but it’s risky. Let’s just pick a slogan,
pitch, motto and keep it simple. Many marketing texts say that you
should really assume that somebody inthe 8th grade should be able to
read it and understand its meaning. But there’s also a second point:
people have zero time nowadays and if your message is unclear… well, you
lose.

So my template would be:

X is a Y which/for Z. It’s for V.

Replace X with your product name.

Replace Y with one of the choices:

-   If it’s something on your computer, it’s a “program”
    > or “application”.

-   If it needs WWW, and I need a browser for it, it’s a “service”

-   It it needs both, it’s a “solution” or “environment” (and perhaps a
    > service too)

-   If it needs hardware, it’s a “platform” or an “infrastructure”

Replace Z with a short sentence which must have one of the verbs:

-   Build

-   Test

-   Deploy

-   etc.

Replace V with your potential customer name.

So let’s try:

X = Docker

Y = Solution

Z = Sandboxing programs

V = Developers and sysadmins.

Result:

>
> Docker is an environment for sandboxing programs. It’s for developers
> and sysadmins.
>

And by the way, there are people who get it **very** well. Here’s an
example:

Have you ever read a product pitch and still didn’t get what it does? I
would like to learn about it.
