Agenda of the Website
---------------------
- Barely Usable (BU) is a collaborative website; guest writers are welcome.
- It's supposed to target wide variety of individuals, from designers to
  engineers
- Content should not be too negative, but instructional instead:
  - every post should have a section on how a thing being analyzed was meant
    to be used
  - discuss what's the problem with existing approach
  - how an object could be engineered better

Main topics
-----------

- usability engineering
- UI/UX
- design of nowadays things

Why?
----

Barely Usable was created because:

- users often see problems with usability in front of the computer, but
  never share what they were. Barely Usable hopes to become a website for
  sharing these thoughts (but no bragging!)

- when stumbled upon a usability problem, we want to understand if other
  users also face similar problems

- we try to become better UI/UX designers

- we hope to engage a community who is not afraid of deep dives into
  usability of engineering problems.
