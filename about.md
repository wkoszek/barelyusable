Barely Usable is a collaborative website; guest writers are welcome.
It's supposed to target a wide variety of individuals, from designers to
  engineers.
Content should not be too negative but instead instructional. See the “Contributing” page for the format of articles.

Main topics of this website include:

- Usability engineering
- UI/UX
- Design of modern products

### Reasoning

Barely Usable was created because:

- Users often see problems with usability when working in front of their computer but
  never share what these problems are. Barely Usable hopes to become a website for
  sharing these thoughts (but not bragging!).

- When stumbling upon a usability problem, we want to understand if other
  users also face similar problems.

-  We are trying to become better UI/UX designers.

- We hope to engage with a community who is not afraid of diving deep into
  usability engineering problems.
